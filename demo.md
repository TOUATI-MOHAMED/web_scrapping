How do you scrape a website with Python and BeautifulSoup?
First, we need to import all the libraries that we are going to use. 
Next, declare a variable for the url of the page. 
Then, make use of the Python urllib2 to get the HTML page of the url declared. 
Finally, parse the page into BeautifulSoup format so we can use BeautifulSoup to work on it.
